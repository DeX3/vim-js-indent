vim-js-indent
=============

Vim indenter for standalone and embedded JavaScript.

Introduction
------------

This is an indenter for standalone and HTML-embedded JavaScript. It's based on
Preston Koprivica's
[JavaScript Indent plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1840),
but it uses the current HTML indenter from Vim 7.4 and has a few other minor
modifications.
